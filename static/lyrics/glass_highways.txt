You know I’m with you here and now
You know I’m here for safety
Cuz the devil’s trapped you in his house
And you can’t escape the feeling

Don’t lead me down this road right now
It’s made of glass, it’s a mystery
It's shattering with every mile
And you know you’ll cut right through me

Highways of glass, speeding fast
They barely leave you breathing
Cuz any stone, or unknown
Could break the road that’s leading
Us along, shall we go on?

Please don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways

So will we make it home alright
Or is this ride deceiving 
Will our smiles by day be tears by night
On this highway meant for healing 

Highways of glass, speeding fast
They barely leave you breathing
Cuz any stone, heavy load
Could break this road that’s leading
Us along, shall we go on?

Please don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways

Take me back, take me home
Are we too far out?
Are we too far gone?

Please don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
Don’t drive me drive me down, glass highways
